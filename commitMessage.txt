Defined an orchestrator service & button class

The orchestrator service will handle bundling the 3 services i need to create
and will make them available at the root component "App". The calcButton class
is a repeatable definition of what each button must do.

Currently trying to avoid writing up 18 different components for each button. 
The approach is instaniate multiple CalcButtonComponents with button values
specified in the ButtonComponent that calls it.
